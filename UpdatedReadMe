there is alot of dependencies for this you will need 
python
npm install
then i did
sudo apt update
after that i did 
apt list --upgradable
this should get you all the dependencies splalchemy, flask, ect
then you do python app.py
then change the 5000 port to public port
then all you have to do is npm run start
and it should work
